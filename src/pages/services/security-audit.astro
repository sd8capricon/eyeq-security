                    EyeQ's team of security consultants can design and tailor a
                    building security audit based on a client's or community's
                    unique needs. The security audit will assess vulnerabilities
                    and then provide clients with detailed recommendations on
                    how to improveâ€”from overlooked aspects of building security
                    to local area crime patterns, from existing security systems
                    testing to staff training and policy compliance.
