        your business. Keep reading to learn more.

    <p slot="first-paragraph">
        While knowing how to respond to threats should be a priority, thereâ€™s
        one thing that's more important and effective at protecting your
        property: prevention.
    </p>
    <p slot="second-paragraph">
        The goal is to never have to put your response plan into action; if you
        effectively prevent threats, you won't have to. Risk management reduces
        your organization&#39;s potential exposure to threats.
